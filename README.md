Frameworks for REST API:
  - Node.js
  - Express.js
  - Node Fetch 
  
 Frameworks for UI:
  - HTML
  - CSS: used FontAwesome
  
  To run this first download this repo on to your system and place it in a folder.
  Then open server.js and in the terminal type:
  
  node server.js
  
  after this open google chrome - go to url:
  
  localhost:3000
  
  now you can type in a subreddit and it will show you the result.
  
  
  Notes:
  - I integerated the rest api and the UI together so you cant run 1 on its own both of them work as one system.
  
  - The HTML file gets search from the user input and this is stored as a variable in script.js which makes the request to my server.js REST api and then send it back to the HTML file.
